Somehow, I found a personal blog website where I reflected upon many aspects of life, including tech shoot trouble, politics, history, and some work stuff.</p><p>I thought about building a blog website a few times before, but it was eventually discontinued. I asked myself why I needed a website; there have so many social platforms I can use, but why do I need one? Then, I found my answer - “Social media is written for others, blog is written for myself.” then, I made it.</p><p>I’ve always been terrible at writing until now. When I started writing something, I didn’t know what to do, especially writing in English, so I decided to do more writing in English. It’s slowly changed over time - people cannot learn a skill just by reading about it but take action.</p><p>When I have random musings and thoughts in my head, I will post them out.</p>]]></content>
