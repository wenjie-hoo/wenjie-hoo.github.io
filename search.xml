        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:gray">I know myself too well(an ISFP-A with extreme procrastination) and I know I will not be able to finish my annual review by the end of this year which is 2023, so I decided to start writing now, even though just a few words per day. </span></p><p>One year ago I moved to Wrocław, Poland to start my new studies, I didn’t expect that this year would be the most stimulating year I’ve ever had. When I roll my photo album on my phone, the 2023 section occupies the most of space,  and so many memories are overwhelming coming out of my mind.  </p><p>At the beginning of this year, I was still dating L but we parted ways lately. We travelled a lot and explored so many places in the first half, and we did a lot of funny stupid things together, I had such a great time with her. In February, thanks to her invitation to France, I had the opportunity to stay with a traditional French family and experience what a typical French day looks like. There, I had my first Valentine’s Day date, where I tried a formal French meal in a romantic local restaurant. Starting with an aperitif and ending with a dessert, the total of five courses made me fall in love with French cuisine(baguette is my soulmate).  Walking through a tiny French town makes me feel so peaceful, visiting Saint-Martin priory church made me feel awe and a colourful altarpiece impressed me, and randomly meeting with cats is one of my favourite parts.</p><br><table rules="none" align="center">    <tr>        <td>            <center>            <div>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/5UbJl8i9RI7GBAs.jpg" width="100%" />            </div>                <br/>            </center>        </td>        <td>            <center>            <div>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/HWLD2v5mVwQxMda.jpg" width="100%" />            </div>                <br/>            </center>        </td>        <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/GKl2DL4p1teRurX.jpg" width="100%" />                <br/>            </center>        </td>                    <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/QkzSoFv1UV5Znty.jpg" width="100%" />                <br/>            </center>        </td>                <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/fNGhjRUeClz2oE1.jpg" width="100%" />                <br/>            </center>        </td>           </tr></table><p>We then visited one of the oldest cities in France, Clermont-Ferrand, a city surrounded by volcanic mountains. I was amazed by the view of the city, whether climbing the Puy de Dôme for a panoramic view or wandering through the charming streets steeped in history. In the second week in France, we spent a lot of time exploring the town near Roanne. Interestingly, I found that French culture has a lot in common with mine, even though they are nearly 10,000 km apart.The same old way of doing laundry by a river, the same machine used to sift rice grains, antique furniture have the same pattern, and we both eat grenouille for a thousand years. However I really enjoyed this trip and I will highly recommend people go to visit those smalls town in France, Paris is not everthing.</p><br><table rules="none" align="center">    <tr>        <td>            <center>            <div>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/JkU9wFViStDmrpv.jpg" width="100%" />            </div>                <br/>            </center>        </td>        <td>            <center>            <div>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/8H1IFuOmS3fdgkw.jpg" width="100%" />            </div>                <br/>            </center>        </td>        <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/MmOS4dAQlvxDUfE.jpg" width="100%" />                <br/>            </center>        </td>                    <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/E3Cydr2FtiscD1P.jpg" width="100%" />                <br/>            </center>         </td>       </tr></table><p>With my France trip ending, I spent two days in Venice, the city of canals. I’ve seen Venice so many times in movies or documentaries, but I was still shocked when I saw a Bolt delivery man carrying a huge green bag on his back and boating straight to his customer, or an ambulance boat passing in front of me at breakneck speed with a whistle. The city wasn’t busy at the end of February, so I didn’t face the agony of queuing. Instead, I enjoyed wandering through the narrow alleys and crossing those elegant bridges. </p><br><table rules="none" align="center">    <tr>        <td>            <center>            <div>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/AmOyXLjK96fxbCt.jpg" width="70%" />            </div>                <br/>            </center>        </td>        <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/9jvL5V6u4FQSAcf.jpg" width="70%" />                <br/>            </center>        </td>            <td>            <center>                <img class="drawing" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/i14Bd3JfODLAqkh.jpg" width="70%" />                <br/>            </center>        </td>   </table><p>To be continued…</p><!--I keep asking who has done this, and this goes again with the idea that for a while, just one day, I'm in denial that the love can't continue, and asking myself who has done this, who's gone so far, I don't know, maybe she does. And the fact that I was trying to hang on to this feeling, hang on to her, but I know I can't, it's like a coping mechanism. It's very difficult to accept that the person that you love has turned that love into a burden, into something that you can't do anymore, it's very difficult to come to terms with to eventually make the decision to leave the relationship.-->]]></content>

      <title>Cheese Board</title>
      <link href="/2022/09/05/Cheese-Board/"/>
      <url>/2022/09/05/Cheese-Board/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/09/09/K48QjvIwikXheE3.jpg" alt="cheese board"></p><p>“芝士就是力量”！</p><p>I was shocked by different aspects of European culture since I studied abroad, one of which came from the food. There is a huge difference in food culture between the West and East. In the East, there’ve got fried rice, sushi, tom yum and stir-fry everything. In the West, there are more likely to find fish&amp;chips, pasta, steak and roast recipe. Even though there are a lot of ingredients in common between those two culinary families, the food differs greatly in the ways they use flavours; western dishes seek to create a controlled flavour that is very similar from start to finish, close to the original taste of food ingredients; but eastern cuisine seeks to combine as many different flavours as possible, this vibrant mix of flavours sensations that keeps them coming back more.</p><p>When I was a kid, there was one thing that I was extremely curious of, I kid you not, cheese. My favourite animated comedy was Tom and Jerry. It was funny and taught me that life is meaningless without sharing fun. In the cartoon, Jerry was always trying to steal cheese to eat from Tom, and then I was thinking about what the cheese tasted like.</p><p>I moved to Ireland about one year ago. A few supermarkets are located in the town where I live; every time I go to get some groceries, a massive fridge with a wide range of cheese and dairy products is always at the forefront of supermarkets. Still, I always try to find some ingredients for Asian dishes in the corner. However, I still haven’t tried cheese.</p><p>Once, one of my roommates, an Italian guy, shared a piece of Grana Padano cheese with me. Salty and slightly nutty was my first feeling of taste, but not too bad. Since then, I have started my cheese tour. I have tried many kinds of cheese, such as Italian Parmigiano(Parmesan), blue cheeses, and a variety of cheeses from the Netherlands; most of them tasted sweet, milky, or salty, which is very friendly for people who have first-time taste cheese, but some are not, blue cheese was one, it was tangy, sharp, and the taste of the edible blue mould Penicillium can be overwhelming, I took that as a challenge. My favourite part of the cheese was Brie cheese, smooth textured,  buttery and slightly sweet flavour; cover it on a jam-smeared cracker, yummy. Now, I understand why Jerry steal the cheese.</p><p>Taste buds can be trained, don’t feel reluctant to try food from any other culture. When the essence of the food is experienced, a different discovery will be made, and the true joy of food will be explored. Having cheese makes you happy.</p>]]></content>

Somehow, I found a personal blog website where I reflected upon many aspects of life, including politics, history, tech troubleshooting and some work stuff.</p><p>I thought about building a blog website a few times before, but it was eventually discontinued. I asked myself why I needed a website; there have so many social platforms I can use, but why do I need one? Then, I found my answer - “Social media is written for others, blog is written for myself.” then, I made it.</p><p>I’ve always been terrible at writing until now. When I started writing something, I didn’t know what to do, especially writing in English, so I decided to do more writing in English. It’s slowly changed over time - people cannot learn a skill just by reading about it but take action.</p><p>When I have random musings and thoughts in my head, I will post them out.</p>]]></content>
