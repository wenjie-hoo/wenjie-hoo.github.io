There is a huge difference in food culture between the West and East. In the East, there've got fried rice, sushi, tom yum and stir-fry everything. In the West, there are more likely to find fish&chips, pasta, steak and roast recipe. Even though there are a lot of ingredients in common between those two culinary families, the food differs greatly in the ways they use flavours; western dishes seek to create a controlled flavour that is very similar from start to finish, close to the original taste of food ingredients; but eastern cuisine seeks to combine as many different flavours as possible, this vibrant mix of flavours sensations that keeps them coming back more.\n\nWhen I was a kid, there was one thing that I was extremely curious of, I kid you not, cheese. My favourite animated comedy was Tom and Jerry. It was funny and taught me that life is meaningless without sharing fun. In the cartoon, Jerry was always trying to steal cheese to eat from Tom, and then I was thinking about what the cheese tasted like.\n\nI moved to Ireland about one year ago. A few supermarkets are located in the town where I live; every time I go to get some groceries, a massive fridge with a wide range of cheese and dairy products is always at the forefront of supermarkets. Still, I always try to find some ingredients for Asian dishes in the corner. However, I still haven't tried cheese.\n\nOnce, one of my roommates, an Italian guy, shared a piece of Grana Padano cheese with me. Salty and slightly nutty was my first feeling of taste, but not too bad. Since then, I have started my cheese tour. I have tried many kinds of cheese, such as Italian Parmigiano(Parmesan), blue cheeses, and a variety of cheeses from the Netherlands; most of them tasted sweet, milky, or salty, which is very friendly for people who have first-time taste cheese, but some are not, blue cheese was one, it was tangy, sharp, and the taste of the edible blue mould Penicillium can be overwhelming, I took that as a challenge. My favourite part of the cheese was Brie cheese, smooth textured,  buttery and slightly sweet flavour; cover it on a jam-smeared cracker, yummy. Now, I understand why Jerry steal the cheese.\n\nTaste buds can be trained, don't feel reluctant to try food from any other culture. When the essence of the food is experienced, a different discovery will be made, and the true joy of food will be explored. Having cheese makes you happy.","tags":["thought"]},{"title":"How I built this blog site","url":"/2022/08/22/How-I-built-this-blog-site/","content":"\n💡 **[Hexo](https://hexo.io/)** is a straightforward and fast blog static site framework with various themes you can select from.

Hexo will watch for all file changes and automatically render the site. You can press *`Ctrl+C` to stop the server.*\n\n###  2.3. <a name='Postingyourfirstblog'></a>Posting your first blog\n\n```bash\n$ hexo new post \"my first post\"\n```\n\n- Restart the `hexo server`, and you will see your first post!\n\n###  2.4. <a name='Letswritesomething'></a>Let’s write something\n\n- Before writing the first blog, let’s take a look at the Hexo file structure.\n\n```bash\n$ tree -L 3\n\n|-- _config.landscape.yml\n|-- _config.yml\n|-- db.json\n|-- node_modules\n|-- package-lock.json\n|-- package.json\n|-- scaffolds\n|-- source\n|   `-- _posts\n|       |-- hello-world.md\n|       `-- my-first-post.md\n`-- themes\n```\n\n- As we can see, the new post \"my first post\" has been created inside the  `source/_posts` folder, and all of your posts will be stored in this folder if not assigned categories. By default, Hexo has created a  `hello-world.md` tutorial post for us.\n- Now, you can add any content to this new post.\n\n```bash\n$ vim ~/blog/source/_posts/my-first-post.md\n\n\t---\n\ttitle: my first post\n\tdate: 2022-08-21 00:50:27\n\ttags:\n\t---\n\n\tCiao!

Somehow, I found a personal blog website where I reflected upon many aspects of life, including politics, history, tech troubleshooting and some work stuff.\n\nI thought about building a blog website a few times before, but it was eventually discontinued. I asked myself why I needed a website; there have so many social platforms I can use, but why do I need one? Then, I found my answer - “Social media is written for others, blog is written for myself.” then, I made it.\n\nI've always been terrible at writing until now. When I started writing something, I didn't know what to do, especially writing in English, so I decided to do more writing in English. It's slowly changed over time - people cannot learn a skill just by reading about it but take action.\n\nWhen I have random musings and thoughts in my head, I will post them out.","categories":["thought"]}]
