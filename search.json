1，Gate ABC D59-87区域是欧盟境内，Lounge2是境外需要重新安检过边境。跟着中转指示可以很轻易到中转大厅和找到出处，穿过三道蓝色充满科技的门后就到了机场大厅。从机场到阿姆市中心强烈推荐坐火车，在机场大厅可以可以找到很多黄色的火车票售卖机，直接买到中央火车站Amsterdam Central即可，票价5.9欧，站台都在-1楼，跟着指示牌也可以轻松找到，个人更推荐下载NS在app上买票，比纸质票更便宜1欧只要4.9欧，打票完可直接上车大概15-20分钟到中央火车站。\n\n个人喜欢徒步，于是并没有坐地铁或电车而漫无目的在街头闲逛，从主火车站出来后基本就是市中心了，\n阿姆斯特丹给我的第一感觉就是自行车真多，真的车比人多，五颜六色造型各异的自行车一大清早就在路上横冲直撞，速度那叫一个惊人。每条车道的右边都有一条自行车道，再右边才是人行道，而人行道和自行车道的红绿灯都是独立的，起初还想吐槽交通看懂之后才理解为什么它被称为自行车之城。\n\n未完...","tags":["travel"],"categories":["travel"]},{"title":"Linear

That sudden, heart-pounding moment of romance, followed by incredibly vivid and exciting fantasies. Last week, this unexpected feeling took me by surprise. I always thought I knew exactly what kind of person I was looking for, but the instantaneous romance truly turned me in. It was just a stare, and I found myself drenched in her blue eyes. I don't know much about her, we've met each other several times, mostly at coffee shops or for lunch . I don't know what triggered this feeling, but there's something irresistibly attractive about her that makes me want to know her better.\n\nI've been obsessing in some romantic fantasies in the past few days. In these daydreams, she is uniquely captivating, the centre of all things interesting, warm, beautiful, and delightful, as if she were the most wonderful person in the world. Scenes from the moments we spent together keep replaying in my mind, the excitement when we discussed similar interests, the awkward blush when she ran into someone familiar at Empik, and the eye contact when we asked about each other's eye colours. At that moment, I saw butterflies.\n\nThese daydreams have persisted, and I find myself thinking about her unintentionally. We share some of our favorite reels on Instagram every day. Each time I receive a message from her, it brightens my day, and I can hardly believe that someone like me, who rarely dreams, is now dreaming of her. But upon waking, I realize that it's like living in a sad yet addictive dream. I know deep down that it won't happen, yet I can't help but indulge in these fantasies. Now that the dream is over, I must return to reality. I know these are just my fantasies, we don't truly know each other and we're cool now being friends. I shouldn't burst this bubble now.\n\nI enjoy meeting her and chatting with her. Even though sometimes we don't understand what the other is saying, there's a certain quality she possesses that makes me interested. Perhaps now isn't the best time to tell her how I feel, but I will. I'll say, \"I have a crush on you, and I want to know you more.\"\n\nI get lost in your eyes.\n\n","tags":["thought"],"categories":["thought"]},{"title":"My 2023 in Retrospect","url":"/2023/11/25/My-2023-in-Retrospect/","content":"\n<span style=\"color:gray\">I know myself too well(an ISFP-A with extreme procrastination) and I know I will not be able to finish my annual review by the end of this year which is 2023, so I decided to start writing now, even though just a few words per day. </span>\n\nOne year ago I moved to Wrocław, Poland to start my new studies, I didn't expect that this year would be the most stimulating year I've ever had. When I roll my photo album on my phone, the 2023 section occupies the most of space,  and so many memories are overwhelming coming out of my mind.  \n\nAt the beginning of this year, I was still dating L but we parted ways lately. We travelled a lot and explored so many places in the first half, and we did a lot of funny stupid things together, I had such a great time with her. In February, thanks to her invitation to France, I had the opportunity to stay with a traditional French family and experience what a typical French day looks like. There, I had my first Valentine's Day date, where I tried a formal French meal in a romantic local restaurant. Starting with an aperitif and ending with a dessert, the total of five courses made me fall in love with French cuisine(baguette is my soulmate).  Walking through a tiny French town makes me feel so peaceful, visiting Saint-Martin priory church made me feel awe and a colourful altarpiece impressed me, and randomly meeting with cats is one of my favourite parts.\n\n<br>\n<table rules=\"none\" align=\"center\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/5UbJl8i9RI7GBAs.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>\n\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/HWLD2v5mVwQxMda.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t</div>\t\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>\n\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/GKl2DL4p1teRurX.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>    \n        \t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/QkzSoFv1UV5Znty.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>        \n        <td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/03/fNGhjRUeClz2oE1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>       \n\t</tr>\n</table>\n\nWe then visited one of the oldest cities in France, Clermont-Ferrand, a city surrounded by volcanic mountains. I was amazed by the view of the city, whether climbing the Puy de Dôme for a panoramic view or wandering through the charming streets steeped in history. In the second week in France, we spent a lot of time exploring the town near Roanne. Interestingly, I found that French culture has a lot in common with mine, even though they are nearly 10,000 km apart.The same old way of doing laundry by a river, the same machine used to sift rice grains, antique furniture have the same pattern, and we both eat grenouille for a thousand years. However I really enjoyed this trip and I will highly recommend people go to visit those smalls town in France, Paris is not everthing.\n\n<br>\n<table rules=\"none\" align=\"center\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/JkU9wFViStDmrpv.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>\n\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/8H1IFuOmS3fdgkw.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t</div>\t\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>\n\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/MmOS4dAQlvxDUfE.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center>\n\t\t</td>    \n        \t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<center>\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"drawing\" src=\"https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/04/E3Cydr2FtiscD1P.jpg\" width=\"100%\" />\n\t\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t</center> \n\t\t</td>   \n\t</tr>\n</table>\n\nWith my France trip ending, I spent two days in Venice, the city of canals. I've seen Venice so many times in movies or documentaries, but I was still shocked when I saw a Bolt delivery man carrying a huge green bag on his back and boating straight to his customer, or an ambulance boat passing in front of me at breakneck speed with a whistle. The city wasn't busy at the end of February, so I didn't face the agony of queuing.

This time I visited Bologna, Modena, Florence and Pisa, it's was kind of sad for me during this trip, I was ghostd by some old sad memories, never mind it is another story.\n\nTo be continued...\n\n<!--\nI keep asking who has done this, and this goes again with the idea that for a while, just one day, I'm in denial that the love can't continue, and asking myself who has done this, who's gone so far, I don't know, maybe she does. And the fact that I was trying to hang on to this feeling, hang on to her, but I know I can't, it's like a coping mechanism. It's very difficult to accept that the person that you love has turned that love into a burden, into something that you can't do anymore, it's very difficult to come to terms with to eventually make the decision to leave the relationship.\n-->\n\n\n\n\n","tags":["travel","thought"],"categories":["thought"]},{"title":"It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me","url":"/2023/09/22/It-s-me-hi-I-m-the-problem-it-s-me/","content":"\n\n不知不觉一年过去了，当初建站的初衷都已忘记，主要还是因为懒。作为一个巨蟹ISFP，有时内心戏十足却不知道该怎么表达，也找不到人分享，憋着自己又难受，兜兜转转想起自己搭的小破站，之后把这当成树洞也不错。\n\n最近特别喜欢ALL TOO WELL，先来100遍。\n\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative;

There is a huge difference in food culture between the West and East. In the East, there've got fried rice, sushi, tom yum and stir-fry everything. In the West, there are more likely to find fish&chips, pasta, steak and roast recipe. Even though there are a lot of ingredients in common between those two culinary families, the food differs greatly in the ways they use flavours; western dishes seek to create a controlled flavour that is very similar from start to finish, close to the original taste of food ingredients; but eastern cuisine seeks to combine as many different flavours as possible, this vibrant mix of flavours sensations that keeps them coming back more.\n\nWhen I was a kid, there was one thing that I was extremely curious of, I kid you not, cheese. My favourite animated comedy was Tom and Jerry. It was funny and taught me that life is meaningless without sharing fun. In the cartoon, Jerry was always trying to steal cheese to eat from Tom, and then I was thinking about what the cheese tasted like.\n\nI moved to Ireland about one year ago. A few supermarkets are located in the town where I live; every time I go to get some groceries, a massive fridge with a wide range of cheese and dairy products is always at the forefront of supermarkets. Still, I always try to find some ingredients for Asian dishes in the corner. However, I still haven't tried cheese.\n\nOnce, one of my roommates, an Italian guy, shared a piece of Grana Padano cheese with me. Salty and slightly nutty was my first feeling of taste, but not too bad. Since then, I have started my cheese tour. I have tried many kinds of cheese, such as Italian Parmigiano(Parmesan), blue cheeses, and a variety of cheeses from the Netherlands; most of them tasted sweet, milky, or salty, which is very friendly for people who have first-time taste cheese, but some are not, blue cheese was one, it was tangy, sharp, and the taste of the edible blue mould Penicillium can be overwhelming, I took that as a challenge. My favourite part of the cheese was Brie cheese, smooth textured,  buttery and slightly sweet flavour; cover it on a jam-smeared cracker, yummy. Now, I understand why Jerry steal the cheese.\n\nTaste buds can be trained, don't feel reluctant to try food from any other culture. When the essence of the food is experienced, a different discovery will be made, and the true joy of food will be explored. Having cheese makes you happy.","tags":["thought"]},{"title":"How I built this blog site","url":"/2022/08/23/How-I-built-this-blog-site/","content":"\n💡 **[Hexo](https://hexo.io/)** is a straightforward and fast blog static site framework with various themes you can select from.

Somehow, I found a personal blog website where I reflected upon many aspects of life, including politics, history, tech troubleshooting and some work stuff.\n\nI thought about building a blog website a few times before, but it was eventually discontinued. I asked myself why I needed a website; there have so many social platforms I can use, but why do I need one? Then, I found my answer - “Social media is written for others, blog is written for myself.” then, I made it.\n\nI've always been terrible at writing until now. When I started writing something, I didn't know what to do, especially writing in English, so I decided to do more writing in English. It's slowly changed over time - people cannot learn a skill just by reading about it but take action.\n\nWhen I have random musings and thoughts in my head, I will post them out.","categories":["thought"]}]
